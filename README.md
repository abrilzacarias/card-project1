### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first project like, ever. I learned A LOT about CSS and even i learned to use Git to make commits and push the updates, that was unexpected but i think it's important anyway. I am aware there's a lot to improve but I'm happy with the result, i think it looks pretty similar. There's still a long way to go but i'm happy with my first project :)


### Continued development

I want to learn how to make it responsive, i don't know that yet, i want to work with a methodology too, i just know one and i didn't know how to implement it while i was working on this so i prefered not to use it. 

### Useful resources

- [CSS's float](https://www.mclibre.org/consultar/amaya/css/css-posicionamiento-flotante.html) - This helped me with the position. I didn't know how correctly use this property and this article helped me a lot.
